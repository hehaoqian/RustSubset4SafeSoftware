# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Rationale
[rationale]: #rationale

- What is the benefit of this rule?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

What other rules have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:

- Does this rule exist for other programming languages and does it pull its weight there?
- Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other specifications, provide readers of the rule with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other rule sets.

Note that while precedent set by other style guides is some motivation, it does not on its own motivate the creation of a rule.
